Evaluation Of Automated Code Documentation Approaches
  
  
  
  ## Preprocessing
  The preprocessing procedure can be invoked by using preprocess_main.py. This file triggers preprocessing procedures sequentially. 
  
  ## Training 
  The training has to be invoked seperately for each approach. Details on how to train each models are available at the authors repositories:  
  
  ## Evaluation
  All approaches can be evaluated sequentially with evaluate_main.py. This requires the preprocessed data and the prediction files from models.
